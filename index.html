Durian first made landfall in the Philippines, packing strong winds and heavy rains that caused mudflows near Mayon Volcano. After causing massive damage in the Philippines.

As it made a landfall in Eastern Visayas, it has already intensified into a typhoon. And as it move into the country, TY 'Frank' had induced the southwest monsoon that caused landslides, flooding and storm surges along the eastern and western seaboards. Severely affected in terms of damage to infrastructure and the number of directly affected persons were the provinces of Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan and Antique in Region VI; and Leyte and Eastern Samar in Region VIII. Also affected by flooding due to moderate and heavy rains brought by the enhanced southwest monsoon, were the provinces of Maguidanao and Shariff Kabunsuan in ARMM; and Cotabato City and North Cotabato in Region XII.

Essential services including power, communications and transportation had been disrupted and extensive impact was also expected on local staple crops of rice and corn.

It then moved Southeast at over Bashi channel at 11 kph. Tropical Depression "Maring" shifted to East Southeast direction while maintaining its speed and intensity of 55 kph near the center in the evening of the same day. Tropical Cyclone "Maring" enchanced the southwest monsoon while it was almost stationary, bringing heavy to occasionally intense rains over Luzon, particulary the Western section that caused extensive flooding over the National Capital Region (NCR) and to other provinces in Luzon.

                                                        During the past three (3) months, rainfall analyses showed that impacts of below normal rainfall conditions in provinces of Western Mindanao and Ilocos Norte were already xperienced and are expected to continue.
                                                        The El Niño is anticipated to be weak and will likely result to below normal rainfall conditions in different parts of the country in the coming months. With this development, the El Niño watch issued since July 2018 is upgraded to El Niño advisory on 20 February 2019.

The first, a magnitude 6.6 in Tulunan at 09:04; the second, a magnitude 6.1 and 9km deep at 10:42 with almost the same epicentre. Just two days after, on 31 October 2019 at 09:15, another tectonic1 magnitude 6.5 earthquake shook central and eastern Mindanao at a shallow depth of two kilometres. The epicentre was again identified in Tulunan, North Cotabato2. A state of calamity3 was declared for Davao del Sur on 30 October and Cotabato on 5 November, the two hardest hit provinces. These earthquakes, as well as the magnitude 6.3 earthquake recorded on 16 October 2019, with the same epicentre location, are considered part of a sequence of events resulting from interdependent faults in the region. No tsunami warnings were issued but many aftershocks, ranging from magnitude 1.5 to 5.5 were recorded.
